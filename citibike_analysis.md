## Business Proposal
# Bike-sharing program for Des Moines, Iowa


## Summary

After a great vacation in New York, we realized one key aspect of a great vacation and to know the city was CitiBike. We would like to present a business proposal to open a branch of CitiBike in Des Moines and present some data to show why Des Moines is a good choice for this.

For a the tourist that likes to see open spaces and country roads rather than crowded urban areas, this is attractive.

## Service capacity example: McDonald's branches

Service capacity in Des Moines is far from reaching its limit. For example, a fast food service provider like McDonalds is currently attending an average of 148 065 persons per branch in NY county, while in Des Moines the number goes down by 87% (18 493 persons per branch).

This is an amazing opportunity to invest in tourism on wheels at Des Moines City.
